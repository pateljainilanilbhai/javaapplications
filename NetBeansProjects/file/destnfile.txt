I returned from the City about three o'clock on that 
May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. 
I had been three months in the Old Country, and was 
fed up with it. 
If anyone had told me a year ago that I would have 
been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; 
but there was the fact. 
The weather made me liverish, 
the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick, 
I couldn't get enough exercise, and the amusements 
of London seemed as flat as soda-water that 
has been standing in the sun. 
'Richard Hannay,' I kept telling myself, 'you 
have got into the wrong ditch, my friend, and 
you had better climb out.'
